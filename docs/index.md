The **American Legal Lexicon** is a comprehensive research agenda spearheaded by [Jake S. Truscott](https://polisci.ufl.edu/directory/jake-truscott/) (University of Florida) and [Michael K. Romano](https://www.su.edu/faculty-staff/faculty/michael-romano/) (Shendoah University) focusing on the application of high-performance computing systems to study the latent and explicit properties of language employed within the American legal community.
