# Judicial Ideology as Text (Truscott & Romano 2025)

**Abstract**: Explorations of ideology retain special significance in contemporary
studies of judicial politics. While some existing methodologies draw on
voting patterns and coalition alignments to map a jurist’s latent features,
many are otherwise reliant on supplemental proxies – often directly from
adjacent actors or via assessments from various prognosticators. We propose an alternative that not only leverages observable judicial behavior,
but does so through jurists’ articulations on the law. In particular, we
adapt a hierarchical factor model to demonstrate how latent ideological
preferences emerge through the written text of opinions. Relying on opinion content from Justices of the Supreme Court, we observe a discernible
correlation between linguistic choices and latent expressions of ideology
irrespective of known ideological preferences or voting patterns. Testing
our method against validated and commonly used measures of judicial
ideology, we find that our approach strongly correlates with existing measures. We conclude by discussing the intuitive power of text as a feature of
judicial ideology, as well as how this process can extend to judicial actors
and institutions beyond the Supreme Court.
